## Project Structure

The project is organized into several components, each contributing to the overall OOP design:

- **Audio:** Manages various audio elements, including alternate phone calls and pre-night sounds.

- **Images:** Addresses image-related issues, ensuring camera images display seamlessly.

- **MenuAnimation:** Optimizes the menu animation for improved visual appeal and performance.

- **lib:** Organizes and uploads libraries for enhanced development efficiency.

- **nbproject:** Includes configurations and miscellaneous fixes for NetBeans projects.

- **src:** Merges the primary source code, incorporating updates and fixes.

## Object-Oriented Approach

- **Class-Based Design:** Utilizes a class-based structure for various game elements, such as characters, audio control, and user interfaces.

- **Encapsulation:** Ensures encapsulation of functionalities within respective classes for better code organization and maintenance.

- **Inheritance:** Utilizes inheritance for characters and user interface elements, promoting code reuse.

- **Polymorphism:** Implements polymorphic behavior for interactive elements, enhancing flexibility and extensibility.

## Contributions

This project reflects the collaborative efforts of developers who have contributed to its evolution. Each contribution aligns with the principles of OOP, providing a robust foundation for the game.

## Project Files Navigation

- **.gitignore:** Excludes unnecessary files from version control, ensuring a clean repository.

- **AnimationImages.txt:** Contains data related to animation images, contributing to the visual aspects of the game.

- **Config.txt:** Includes configurations, such as power indicators and bug fixes.

- **build.xml and manifest.mf:** Facilitate project upload and organization.
